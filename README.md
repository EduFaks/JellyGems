# JellyGems

JellyGems was a game developed when I was 15 years old. A multiplayer game where players (represented as jellies) try to capture as many gems as possible. 

All aspects, such as packets for communication with the server, sockets, scoreboards, and visual models, were made by myself. The code is a mess and doesn't follow any structure; it was developed in a rush during my early programming carrier as a personal project to build my knowledge in programming.

## Status

_NOT-WORKING_

This game was never finished or even worked with multiplayer. My goal is to refractor it and slowly make it work.
